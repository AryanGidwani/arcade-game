The user will start out with a total of 1000 coins. The user will bet a certain amount of money, and will guess either higher or lower, and then the program will roll two dice. If the sum of the two rolls is in the range of 2 to 6, then it is classified as lower, while if the sum of the rolls is in the range of 8 to 12, then it is classified as higher. If the sum of the rolls is a 7, it is deemed as neutral. If the user were to guess the opposite of what happened, they would lose the money that they bet; however, if they guess correctly, the money that the user bet would be doubled and added to the user's total coins.
